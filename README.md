# Application Preferences plugin for Phonegap #
Originally by Simon MacDonald (@macdonst)

## Adding the Plugin to your project ##

1) To install the plugin, move applicationPreferences.js to your project's www folder and include a reference to it in your html files.

`<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="applicationPreferences.js"></script>`

2) Create a folder called 'com/simonmacdonald/prefs' within your project's src folder.
3) And copy the AppPreferences.java file into that new folder.

`mkdir <your_project>/src/com/simonmacdonald/prefs`

`cp ./src/com/simonmacdonald/prefs/AppPreferences.java <your_project>/src/com/simonmacdonald/prefs`

4) In your res/xml/plugins.xml file add the following line:

    `<plugin name="applicationPreferences" value="com.simonmacdonald.prefs.AppPreferences"/>`

## Using the plugin ##
The plugin creates the object `window.plugins.applicationPreferences`

### get ###

In order to get the value a property you would call the get method.

    /**
      * Get the value of the named property.
      *
      * @param key           
      */
    get(key, success, fail)

Sample use:

    window.plugins.applicationPreference.get("key", success, fail);

### set ###

In order to set the value a property you would call the set method.

    /**
      * Set the value of the named property.
      *
      * @param key
      * @param value           
      */
    set(key, value, success, fail)

Sample use:

    window.plugins.applicationPreference.set("key", "value", success, fail);

### load ###

In order to get all the properties you can call the load method. The success callback of the load method will be called with a JSONObject which contains all the preferences.

    /**
      * Get all the preference values.
      *
      */
    load(success, fail)

Sample use:

    window.plugins.applicationPreference.load(success, fail);

### show ###

If you want to load the PreferenceActivity of your application that displays all the preferences you can call the show method with the class name.

    /**
      * Get all the preference values.
      *
      */
    show(activity, success, fail)

Sample use:
    
    window.plugins.applicationPreference.show("com.simonmacdonald.prefs.PreferenceActivity", success, fail);
